## Motivation

Many developers and content creators need a lightweight way to turn Markdown into HTML without the overhead of full frameworks like Jekyll, Hugo, or anything JavaScript-heavy. This static site generator was built with that in mind:

- Lightweight & Fast: No dependencies, no setup headaches ‚Äî just Markdown in, HTML out.

- Perfect for GitHub Pages: Outputs to a docs directory for seamless deployment.

- Fully Customizable: Ideal for personal sites, documentation, or blogs where you want full control over structure and styling.

- Educational Value: Designed as a hands-on project to deepen understanding of file I/O, Markdown parsing, and static site architecture.

Whether you're publishing a personal blog or building a portfolio, this tool gives you exactly what you need ‚Äî and nothing you don‚Äôt.
